# Study for Marine Protected Area managers:
# What does your workforce include?

<br>

<p>Thanks for participating in this <b><i>voluntary</i></b> study— your input is valuable. <i>Please consider the information in this <a href='https://youtu.be/M3Nm5KuyN_Q?si=-bIdGoTAr2H3lsoV' target='blank'>about</a> document and ask any <a href='mailto:christine@eOceans.co'>questions</a> you may have before deciding if you will participate.</i> You can also watch a short video about why this project matters <a href=' https://www.eoceans.org/mpa-workforce-study-2025-about' target='blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p>As the world moves toward protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030,
<a href='https://marine-conservation.org/' target='_blank'>the Marine Conservation Institute (MPAtlas)</a>,
<a href='https://www.eoceans.org/' target='_blank'>eOceans</a>,
<a href='https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/' target='_blank'>the Leibniz-IZW</a>,
<a href='https://iucn.org/our-union/commissions/world-commission-protected-areas/' target='_blank'>the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas</a>,
<a href='https://www.rewild.org/' target='_blank'>Re:wild</a>, and
<a href='https://www.bluenaturealliance.org/' target='_blank'>Blue Nature Alliance</a>
have partnered to understand the MPA workforce — this includes staff,
employees, and others who have a formal role actively contributing to achieving the goals of a specific MPA.</p>

<p>This study aims to create a clear picture of the workforce behind current MPAs and give us an idea of what may be needed as the number of MPAs grows.</p>
	
### Here's how it works:	

<span>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Part A</strong>: 2 questions: Let's identify your MPA.</li>
  <li><strong>Part B</strong>: 4 questions: Tell us about this MPA.</li>
  <li><strong>Part C</strong>: 4 questions: Tell us about you. </li>
  <li><strong>Part D</strong>: 2 (optional) questions: Tell us more? </li>
</ul>
</span>

<p>️🎬 Before you jump in, don't hesitate to watch a walkthrough of the survey <a href='https://youtu.be/h6fAi9vLI4U?si=95ux3CsgE5EItlUit' target='blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p>💡 Click <a href='https://www.eoceans.org/mpa-workforce-study-2025-about' target='blank'>here</a> to learn about <em>Data Access</em>, <em>Risks</em>, <em>Support</em>, <em>Funders</em>, and more.</p>

<p>🪼 <strong>Thank you!</strong><br>
Your input is invaluable to this study and will provide crucial insights for others working on MPAs like you.<br>
Together, we’re strengthening the global MPA network.</p>
