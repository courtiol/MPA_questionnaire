# Study for Marine Protected Area managers:
# What does your workforce include?

<br>

<p>We invite you to participate in this Global Marine Protected Area Workforce Study!</p>

<p>As the world moves toward protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030,
<a href='https://www.bluenaturealliance.org/' target='_blank'>Blue Nature Alliance</a>,
<a href='https://marine-conservation.org/' target='_blank'>Marine Conservation Institute (MPAtlas)</a>,
<a href='https://www.eoceans.app/' target='_blank'>eOceans</a>, and
<a href='https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/' target='_blank'>Leibniz-IZW</a>
have partnered to understand the MPA workforce — this includes staff,
employees, and others who have a formal role actively contributing to achieving the goals of a specific MPA.</p>

<p>This study aims to create a clear picture of the workforce behind current MPAs and give us an idea of what may be needed as the number of MPAs grows.</p>
	
### Here's how it works:	

<ul>
  <li>Part A: 2 questions: Identify the MPA you are responding for.</li>
  <li>Part B: 6 questions: Tell us about your specific MPA.</li>
  <li>Part C: 5 questions: Tell us about you. </li>
  <li>Part D: 2 final optional questions. </li>
</ul>

<p>💡 Click <strong>here</strong> to learn about <em>Data Access</em>, <em>Risks</em>, <em>Support</em>, <em>Funders</em>, and more.</p>

<p>💙 <strong>Thank you!</strong><br>
Your input is invaluable to this study and will provide crucial insights for others working on MPAs like you.<br>
Together, we’re strengthening the global MPA network.</p>

<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong><br>	
Beth Pike, Marine Conservation Institute<br>
