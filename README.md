<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The scripts in this folder are used to create the [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B-DeYW4-xnE0gO2DTQdobg1hIGTTafkBLkgfomhUIBE/edit?usp=sharing) required by the questionnaire.

The sheet called *survey* includes the different elements of the questionnaire.

The sheet called *choices* includes the items used for large multiple choice questions (choice of country and of MPA).

Note that running the script requires to create (or own) a large R object.
Doing so is computationally intensive and should not be attempted on a laptop.
So better ask Alex for the data in case you need them.
